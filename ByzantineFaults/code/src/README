To launch the simulator some previous steps must be done:

1) create the xml for the platform and the deployment file. To do this:
javac Create_xml_files_centralised.java
java Create_xml_files_centralised nb_workers nb_clients

The maximum number of workers is 226208. (the traces that permits to create our xml file correspond to trace of seti@home during 1,5 years, and there are only 226208 nodes present in it).

2) transform the database in a file. We use the cluster big in order to test our code and mysql isn't install on it. So we need to create a new format readable into our code. to do this:
place you in the projet/ directory and do make.
after ./fromMySQLToText name_db

name_db must be the name of a database that you created thanks to a file ".sql" find in the Failure Trace Archive

3) run the simulation:
go in the directory /projet/bin, do cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
./my_boinc file_database number_workers dep_file plat_file SIMULATOR REPUTATION_STRATEGY FORMATION_GROUP_STRATEGY ADDITIONAL_REPLICATION_STRATEGY

file_database corresponds to the file created in phase 2: the name of this file is boinc_file
dep_file and plat_file are the files created in phase 1.
